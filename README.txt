Hello! This is a simulation made for the Beamline For Schools teams called Sigmas.
This simulation represents the total defects predicted for diferent particles at diferent energies levels,
from 5 GeV to 15 Gev.
This simulation is not an exact representation of what could accure and there are more variables that are needed
to take into account.

Use this lines of code in your terminal for the correct work of this program:
pip install numpy
